TranscriptSkimmer
----------------------------

TranscriptSkimmer is a reference-guided assembler for RNASeq experiments. 
It simultaneously assembles transcripts from reads without using a reference 
annotation.  The software expects as input genome sequence in FASTA file and 
RNASeq read alignments in BAM format - binary form of SAM format.
